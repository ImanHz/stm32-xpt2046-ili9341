# Sample program for STM32F7 Nucleo + ILI9341 LCD + XPT2046 SPI Touch IC

This code is HAL compatible and could be ported to other STM32 mcus (and other microcontrollers as well) easily.

XPT2046 is a cheap clone for ADS7846 touch IC.

STM32CubeMX file is also included and could be used to adopt the connections.
